Some people assume that some lucky numbers can bring them good luck. For example, EIGHT is widely used in China today because it sounds like to get rich. On the other hand, FOUR means death both in China and Japan for the same reason.

However, many others do not think so. They consider that the numbers have no affections to be lucky or unlucky. Numbers are used for counting and mathematical computing, have the meaning of science but not relief.

I am agree with the latter opinion. We are living in such a modern society, have no reason to believe such foolish things. Whether we can have good luck depends on ourselves. We will be lucky if we work hard in our daily life.
